Idea: 
Text-based terminal game
Single player game - enemy AI
Replayability - randomized


Game:
Roguelike with rpg elements

Key Components:
- Permadeath
- Procedural Generation (Randomized maps/ dungeons)
- Active Items and Passive items (Abilities) (with synergies)
- Turned - based Combat
- Enemies, minibosses and bosses with item drops
- Treasure chests with loot
- Shop
- (unlockable characters)

Micro Gameplay:
- shows map of current room
- turned based combat - attack, block, item, flee 
- when enter room either explore or leave room
- explore room - either find enemy or chest or both, prio enemy, (small chance chest is a mimic)
- leave room - give direction of adjacent rooms to enter, special rooms: boss room, chest room, shop, (ambush room)
- boss room - Boss taunts player, enter combat, shows health bar of boss
- (enemy room - multiple waves of enemies, one after another)
- chest room - room with a chest, requires a key
- (shop - room with purchasable items and consumables like keys or health)

Macro Gameplay:
- 5 Dungeon levels
- Dungeons get progressively bigger, the deeper the level
- Enemies get stronger the deeper the level
- Loot from chests gets better at deeper levels
- Some enemies spawn at certain levels - some enemies drop specific loot
- Mini-Bosses in floors 1-4 (can be randomized), (possibly from a pool of more bosses)
- Final boss at last floor
- (Secret ending by collecting certain items?)
- (achievements)

Theme:
- Basic RPG enemies: slimes, skeletons, ghouls
- each floor has a different theme (elements)
- top floor: overworld, forest - slimes, giant rats, wild boards, 
- second floor: underground/ dungeon/ graveyard - skeletons, ghouls, wraiths, bats, 
- third floor: sandy, desert - giant scorpions, snakes, vultures
- fourth floor: ice, tundra - wolves, snow golems, snow elementals 
- final floor: hellish, magma - fire elementals, moving magma, demons, fallen angel  
- maybe instead of floors its areas accessed by portals
- (possible basic enemies with regional variants, e.g slime in forest, ice slime in tundra)
- (elemental resistances/ weaknesses?)
